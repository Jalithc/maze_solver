# Maze Solver

This Python program provides functionality to solve mazes using various search algorithms.

## Features

- **Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm**: This program uses the DFS algorithm to find a solution path from the start point to the goal point in a maze.
- **Maze Representation**: Mazes are represented using plain text files, where '#' represents walls, 'A' represents the start point, 'B' represents the goal point, and ' ' (space) represents open paths.
- **Customizable Input**: Users can provide their own maze files to be solved by the program.
- **Visual Solution**: After finding the solution path, the program provides a visual representation of the solved maze.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`maze_solver.py`) and the maze files.
4. Run the `maze_solver.py` script, providing the filename of the maze you want to solve as an argument:
